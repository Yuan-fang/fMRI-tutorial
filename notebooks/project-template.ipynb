    "In each tutorial notebook, I asked you to run an import cell at the very beginning so that all required packages for that notebook would be available. In principle, you can (and in practice, often should) import packages only when you need them. This avoids unnecessary memory use and is generally considered good practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since some of you may still be unfamiliar with package management, I want to reduce friction during your analyses. Below, I provide a single cell that imports **all** the packages you are likely to use to finish this project. I recommend placing this cell at the top of your notebook and running it first. This ensures that all relevant packages are loaded at once, so you don’t need to worry about imports later.\n",
