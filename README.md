A lightweight tutorial for teaching fMRI data analysis in Neurodesk environment.

This is for the course - AS.050.312/AS.050.612 Cognitive Neuroimaging Methods in High-level Vision taught in JHU on fall 2025.


#### Tutorial Structure
In total 6 tutorial sessions. The first session is a basic background introduction on fMRI data analysis tools and reproducible science (including python notebook, Docker, and Neurodesk).

Main tutorual sessions:
- session 0: get to know about fMRI data, e.g., how to display image and get access to the fMRI data.
- session 1: mainly focused on preprocessings by FSL. Also cover fMRIPrep.
- session 2: First-level GLM analysis. 
- session 3: Fixed-effect analysis and second-level group analysis.
- session 4: Multiple comparision correction, results report.

#### Teaching goals:
There are several different levels of goals:
- At the lowest level, students are expected to independently conduct full steps of _voxelwise univariate anlysis_ (from raw data) and report results in a statistically rigorous way.
- At the higher level, students are expected to receive scaffolding and can develop more advanced skills in fMRI at their own pace in the future.
- At the highest level, students are expected to develop a concrete understanding of reproducible science, including BIDS, python notebook, fMRIPrep, and Neurodesk.

#### Assignment structures:
The assignments are structured into two parts. Each has different goals:
- After-class mini-project. This is a very easy project, which basically replicate the contents in the tutorial. This aims to solidify students' skill learned in cllass.
- Final project. This is the final project. Students are expected to work on a more recent as well as more complicated dataset (Openneuro: ds004848). Students are required to do *any* analyes with this dataset. Only constraints are the results need to be significant (p or q < 0.05, corrected) and meaningful (reasonably defensible). This is for students to generalize their skills to more complicated applications.
